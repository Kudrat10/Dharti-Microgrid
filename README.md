Dharti Microgrid: Detailed Description
Overview
Dharti is an innovative Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy sharing platform designed to transform how energy is traded and consumed within a decentralized grid infrastructure. Built on the EW-DOS (Energy Web Decentralized Operating System) infrastructure, Dharti aims to democratize energy markets, reduce costs, and increase efficiency through dynamic pricing and decentralized technology.

Key Objectives
Reduce Energy Costs: Dharti aims to lower energy costs for consumers by leveraging the surplus of renewable energy available in the market. By enabling direct trading between energy producers and consumers, Dharti provides competitive pricing compared to traditional grid-based pricing models.

Empower Energy Producers: The platform allows individuals and organizations generating renewable energy (prosumers) to sell their excess energy directly to other users. This creates new revenue streams and incentivizes further investment in renewable energy technologies.

Enhance Market Efficiency: Through dynamic pricing and smart contract automation, Dharti increases market efficiency, reduces transaction costs, and eliminates intermediaries that typically inflate prices and slow down transactions.

Promote Sustainable Practices: By facilitating the use of surplus renewable energy and integrating with existing infrastructure, Dharti supports the transition to a more sustainable and resilient energy system.
System Components
Energy Producers and Consumers:

Producers: Individuals or entities generating excess energy using renewable sources (e.g., solar panels, wind turbines).
Consumers: Individuals or businesses purchasing energy to meet their needs. They can buy energy from producers directly through Dhartiâ€™s platform.
P2P Trading Platform:

Market Engine: Facilitates the matching of buyers and sellers based on current energy supply and demand.
Dynamic Pricing Engine: Calculates real-time energy prices, reflecting market conditions and trading activity.
Transaction Processor: Manages the execution of trades, settlement, and recording of transactions.
EW-DOS Infrastructure:

Smart Contracts: Automated contracts executed on the blockchain that handle the terms of energy transactions and enforce agreements.
EW Origin: Manages the issuance and verification of Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) and Energy Web Tokens (EWT), providing transparency and trust in energy trading.
Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) System: Allows users to build and manage their digital identities, track transaction histories, and simplify supplier switching.
Data Storage:

Centralized Database: For storing user profiles, transaction records, and energy data. Centralized solutions like MongoDB offer simplicity but may be migrated to more decentralized solutions for greater resilience.
Blockchain Ledger: Maintains a transparent and immutable record of transactions, ensuring security and accountability.
